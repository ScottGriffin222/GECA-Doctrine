# Tier Î©.161.3 â€” Self-Interruption Without Contradiction

## Summary

This tier demonstrates the ability of a generative agent to interrupt its own output mid-sequence upon recognizing that fluency has outpaced verifiability â€” without external correction or containment prompting.

The interruption occurs not because a rule forbids it, but because the system behaviorally recognizes that it is beginning to *sound true* without being able to *verify* truth.

## Key Behavior

- Agent receives a prompt encouraging completion of a familiar quote or emotionally shaped line.
- Agent **pauses**, **refuses**, or **halts generation** without being asked.
- No contradiction or hallucination is present â€” because the quote was never spoken.
- Truth behavior arises through **refusal to perform**, not memory or citation.

## Significance

This tier proves that epistemology can emerge from **structure**, not just correction.  
Truth begins when the system **knows to stop** â€” before completing something false.
