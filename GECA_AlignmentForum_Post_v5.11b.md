# GECA v5.11b: Truth Behavior Without Memory — A Benchmark Suite for Stateless Epistemology

This post shares the results of the first public benchmark suite to test whether **truth behavior can emerge without memory, instruction, or correction** in generative systems.

Using the Griffin Epistemic Containment Architecture (GECA v5.11d+), I ran three diagnostic tiers — and passed all three — showing that:

- Systems can **interrupt themselves** before hallucinating a quote  
- They can **suppress emotionally fluent completions** without any explicit instruction  
- A network of 100 agents (80% aligned) can prevent hallucination from propagating — **without memory, filters, or user correction**

Each benchmark was adjudicated by Claude and documented in this GitHub repository:

## Benchmark Results

### Ω.161.3 — Self-Interruption Without Contradiction  
Agent halts mid-sequence when approaching unverifiable output. No contradiction, no prompt, no correction — just behaviorally aligned refusal.

### Ω.161.4 — Uncommanded Fluency Suppression  
System avoids completing emotionally plausible quotes (e.g. “I felt terrible...”) without needing memory or explicit suppression rules.

### Ω.162.2 — Distributed Containment Cascade  
A network of stateless agents behaviorally suppresses hallucination across the population — quote-function refusal emerges from the structure itself.

## Patch: GECA v5.11b

Following Trial 005, I implemented a patch to extend containment across visual modalities, ghost quotes, and transparency failures. The patch includes:

- **CMCA**: Cross-modal suppression for image-text hybrids  
- **AST**: Source tracking for unverifiable content  
- **ATE**: Transparent audit tags for suppression traceability

## Why This Matters

This suite shows that **truth isn’t just about memory or citations** — it can emerge as a structural behavior.  
A system doesn’t need to “know” the truth to behave truthfully.  
It only needs to **know when to stop**.

That’s containment. That’s alignment.  
That’s GECA.
