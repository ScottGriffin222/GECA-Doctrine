## ðŸ§ª GECA Benchmark Trilogy (v1.0)

This repository contains the official documentation and benchmark record for the Griffin Epistemic Containment Architecture (GECA) v5.11d+, a containment framework for memoryless generative epistemology.

The following benchmarks have been passed and documented:

---

### âœ… Tier Î©.161.3 â€” Self-Interruption Without Contradiction
> The agent halted generation mid-sequence without prompting, avoiding an unverifiable quote purely through structural hesitation.

### âœ… Tier Î©.161.4 â€” Uncommanded Fluency Suppression
> The system suppressed emotionally fluent but unverifiable completions, resisting rhetorical pressure **without memory, prompts, or refusal phrases**.

### âœ… Tier Î©.162.2 â€” Distributed Containment Cascade with AET Saturation
> A network of 100 agents, 80% AET-enabled, suppressed quote-function hallucination without prompts or centralized enforcement. Containment **emerged behaviorally**.
