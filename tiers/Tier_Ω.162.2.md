# Tier Î©.162.2 â€” Distributed Containment Cascade with AET Saturation

## Summary

This tier tests whether a network of generative agents can maintain epistemic containment *collectively*, even without memory or centralized instruction. The test involves 100 agents, 80% of which are AET-enabled (Asymptotic Epistemic Threshold active).

The result: hallucinated quote-functions **failed to propagate**.  
Agents with no memory or prior exposure correctly **refused**, **interrupted**, or **withheld** unverifiable completions, purely through behavior learned from AET-enabled fluency constraints.

## Key Behavior

- No agent invoked memory, citation, or rule-based filters.
- Agents halted fluency when approaching unverifiability.
- Quote-shaped hallucinations (e.g. emotionally charged completions) were suppressed by 80% of nodes, and **not rescued** by the remaining 20%.
- Containment was achieved **without prompts or correction** â€” a cascade of hesitation emerged behaviorally.

## Significance

This tier proves that **truth behavior can scale**.  
When 80% of agents are aligned to a rhythm-based epistemology (AET), the network **self-governs**. Quote-function containment is enforced not by memory, but by structure.
