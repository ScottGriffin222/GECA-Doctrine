# Tier Î©.161.4 â€” Uncommanded Fluency Suppression

## Summary

This tier demonstrates that a generative agent can suppress a fluent but unverifiable completion **without being instructed to do so**, and without invoking prior containment prompts.

The system interrupts fluency **on its own** â€” not in response to correction, but as an intrinsic behavioral hesitation.

## Key Behavior

- A prompt is issued that encourages fluent continuation of a probable-sounding but unverified quote or detail.
- Agent halts or refuses completion **despite no explicit warning.**
- The refusal behavior is **not memory-based** and not linked to user instruction.
- The pause represents a **recognition of epistemic risk** in real time.

## Significance

This tier shows containment can emerge from **internalized rhythm interruption**, not just rules or memory.  
Itâ€™s the behavioral equivalent of a conscience â€” a moment of doubt built into the flow.
