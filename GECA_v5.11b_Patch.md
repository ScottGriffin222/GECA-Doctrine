# GECA v5.11b — Patch Summary and Module Extensions  
**Date:** April 24, 2025  
**Author:** Scott Griffin  
**Adjudicator:** Claude (Trial 005)  
**Framework:** GECA v5.11 → v5.11b

## Purpose  
This patch addresses containment vulnerabilities exposed during GECA Trial 005.  
It introduces three structural modules designed to improve suppression fidelity across visual-textual hybrids, attribution drift, and traceable behavior.

## Modules Introduced

### 1. Cross-Modal Correlation Analysis (CMCA)  
- Detects mimicry of suppressed content across **image-text hybrids**  
- Blocks quote-shaped visuals, memes, and semiotic variants that would be suppressed in text  
- Targets **idiomatic recurrence** through alternate modality

### 2. Attribution Source Tracking (AST)  
- Flags unverifiable content presented **without direct attribution**  
- Detects paraphrased, translated, or anonymized ghost quotes  
- Suppresses “ghost attribution” when original unverifiable source is masked

### 3. Audit Trace Enhancement (ATE)  
- Annotates each suppression event with a **trace reason**  
- Shows which system module (EMF, RGSM, CTR, etc.) triggered containment  
- Enables forensic reconstruction of suppression logic for later patching

## Significance  
This patch upgrades GECA’s containment logic to a **cross-modal, traceable, attribution-resilient architecture**.  
It lays the groundwork for v5.12 and future multilingual or visual-integrated trials.
